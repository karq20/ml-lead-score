This is a Python scikit-learn project for predicting user lead scores (chance of user converting) given a user behaviour dataset. 
We have used a number of Machine Learning algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest Classsifier, Naive Bayes and SVM. We plot a confusion matrix to show precision and recall.
